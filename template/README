How To Use The Bundle Template
------------------------------

0. See http://preview.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/devel/core/toolshed.html
   for documentation on toolshed API
1. Copy the entire template directory as a new tool directory.
2a. If you are providing a single tool and a single command (the
    most common case), do the following:
        - Edit Makefile and looking for the word "FIXME".  Replace
	  the short sentence with information matching your tool.
	- Edit __init__.py and look for the same all-caps constants
	  you just changed in Makefile.  Fix them.
	- Edit gui.py and cmd.py so that the function and variable
	  names match those used in __init__.py.
2b. If you are providing a single tool and multiple commands:
	- Do the same steps as 2a, but use a comma-separated list
	  for the "COMMAND_NAME" variable.
	- When fixing __init__.py, you will need to make the
	  "register_command" function handle multiple command names.
2c. If you are providing multiple tools:
        - Edit Makefile.  You only need to replace the "PKG_*" variables.
	  Get rid of the "TOOL_*" and "COMMAND_*" variables since you
	  will be adding tools manually.
	- Edit setup.py.in and look for "TOOL_NAME".  You will need to
	  create one line for each tool you provide.  Read the documentation
	  in setup.py.in for information about the fields on the line.
	- Edit __init__.py and make "register_command" and "start_tool"
	  handle multiple command names and tools, respectively.
	- Edit gui.py and cmd.py to match __init__.py.
3. "make install".  Good luck.
