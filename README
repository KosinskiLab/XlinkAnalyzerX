This directory contains code for generating a sample ChimeraX bundle
using only an installed ChimeraX application rather than the entire
ChimeraX source tree.

To build the bundle:

1. edit "Makefile" and change "CHIMERAX_APP" to match the location
   of "ChimeraX.app" on your system.
2. Create a "license.txt" file.  The easiest way is to copy
   "license.txt.bsd" to "license.txt".
3. "make"
4. Check directory "dist" to make sure the wheel was created.

To verify that the bundle works:

1. "make app-install" to install the wheel into your copy
   of ChimeraX.app (assuming you have write permission).
2. Check that the bundle works by opening a molecule and executing
   the command "sample count".  It should report the number of atoms
   and bonds for each molecule in the log.
